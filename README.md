Adding the old midnight surfing to userstyles.world. Will try to add changes if I can, when I can. Fast and less resource intensive on mobile. Mainly for websites that do not already provide a dark interface.

### Features
- Dark theme for general web content (News/Blogs/Forums)
- Should be less resource itensive unlike other dark interface extensions
- Copy, Edit, Modify, Publish it as your own.

### Limitations
- Possible design breakage for complicated web apps. (Disable this style for those websites)
- Edge cases can prevent visibility, accessibility of some content. (Disable it while interacting with important websites)
- Only tested with Stylus extension on Firefox (Desktop/Mobile)
- Doesn't work on Facebook with Firefox on Android, while it works on desktop for some reason
- You tell me
